Working on this project as a group gave us valuable experience with both GitHub and project planning. We learned how to use GitHub not only to host our code, but also as a collaboration tool where branches, commits, and pull requests kept our work organized.

For the scrum board we used a Kanban board that we created on github. It helped us clearly separate our tasks into “To Do,” “In Progress,” and “Done” columns, we also assigned each issue to a person and added clear descriptions and labels. This way we avoided any confusion or having two people work on the same task and wasting their time. This visual workflow made it easier to see what each person was working on, avoid overlap, and ensure that the project was moving forward step by step. It also gave us a sense of progress as tasks were moved to “Done,” which was motivating for the whole group. 

Visual Studio Code was also an important part of the process. It allowed us to easily write, test, and debug our code, while also connecting directly with GitHub for version control. This made it simple for everyone in the group to stay in sync. 

The biggest challenge we faced was coordinating branches and make sure each pull request had meaning commits. We started off confused but as a group we eventually figured it. 

The most fulfilling part was running our code in the end and testing the quiz game, we got to see our project finally come to life. 

If we had more time and experience, we would’ve added other interactive features like shuffled questions, different difficulty levels and saving high scores. These changes would really elevate the game and make it more interactive and educational. 

Overall, this group project taught us valuable skills in teamwork, planning and structured workflows that we will carry into our future projects. The kanban board kept us organized and gave us direction, while github and VS code made collaboration smooth. All together these tools helped us complete the project successfully and efficiently.
